# MNExplainer

This is the repo of the paper "MUSE-Explainer : Counterfactual explanations for Symbolic Music Graph classification models" published at the CMMR 2025 conference.
MUSE-Explainer is a new method that helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual explanations by bringing local meaningful changes to music score graphs that alter a modelâ€™s prediction while ensuring the results remain musically coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs.

## Installation and usage

To use this repository, one can simply download the repo :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaptisteHi/MNExplainer.git
```
The ```__main__.py``` file showcases an exemple of using the repo to create an explainer for a given music analysis node classification model, and obtaining explanations for given input graphs.
